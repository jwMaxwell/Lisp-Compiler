# Lisp-Compiler

This LISP compiler is a work in progress. 
Currently the compiler will tokenize input, parse the tokens, print debug information, and output a compiled file. Currently files are compiled to LLVM IR and function support is extremely limited. I am using `g++`, llvm libraries, and `c++20`.
